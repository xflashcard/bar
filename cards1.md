alter ego
# Back
a court will pierce the veil if the corp is treated as a mere instrumentality of another person, the corp form is used wrong, and the pl has suffered an unjust injury or loss 

individual shareholders - should keep corp accoutns separeate from their own - must result in some basic inequity 

parent-subsidiary corps - should be held out to the public as separate entities

inadequate capitalization
# Back
at time of formation shareholders must put risk unencumbered capital reasonably adequate for the corps prospective liabilities - if they fail to do so corp veil may be pierced
# Front
avoidance of existing obligations/fraud

if shareholder uses the corp form to avoid existing personal obligations, the corporate veil will be pierced. however, mere fact that corp form is chosen in order to avoid personal liability is not enough to peirce
# Front
liability when piercing corp veil
# Back
generally only shareholders who were active in management of the business will be held personally liable
